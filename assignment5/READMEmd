I chose the 1960's for this assignment I had a hard time understanding the style CSS page.
I tried to add bright 60's colors like blue orange and yellow.
The colors I chose were {rgb(43, 44, 48)} and rgb(255, 255, 255}
This assignment was probably one of the toughest just trying to understand CSS and the color aspects of web design.
