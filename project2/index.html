    <li> elmers all purpose gule </li>
    <li>a canvas/ surface to paint on </li>
    <li>a towel or tarp </li>
    <li> hair blow dryer </li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
      <li> First you want to lay down a tarp or towel on the surface your working on.
  it is best to use a sturdy table or outside on the sidewalk

  Next pour multiple colors of acrylic paint in one cup do not stir it!
  every 3-4 layers of paint add a little bit of elmers glue.

  Finaly place the canvas ontop of the cup of paint
  quickly flip the cup and canvas so that the cup is upside down ontop of the canvas
  you will see paint on the canvas
  remove the cup slowly and move the canvas around clockwise so that there is an even coat on the canvas

  if you would like now you can add extra layers of paint
  for faster drying time use a hair blow dryer </li>
