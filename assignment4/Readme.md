 Id- id's are known as the â€œglobal identifier the attribute takes as its value a string, which should be a unique identifier to that specific element.
Class- Like the id's attribute, the class attribute is an identifier and selector value for HTML elements. The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value. This allows for easy styling of these elements with same CSS code.
Divs- Divs can be singular or nested within each other. This element is used by developers to increase structural clarity and identify element groups.
 Span element- The span element is equivalent to the <div> element. This means that spans can exist within divs, and do not create full-width blocks. It serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling. You can have multiple span elements inside a div.
 Alt text- One of the most cited uses of alt attributes is to provide text for visitors who can't see images in their browsers. This includes visitors using browsers that cannot display images or have image display disabled, visually impaired visitors, and visitors who use screen readers
 The outline for this assignment was a bit more confusing in terms of content and placement where elements were supposed to be.
