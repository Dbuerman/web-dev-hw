technical report
One of the browsers I use the most is google and the school website 
Browsers send (HTTP) hypertext transfer protocol which sends a request to the server which sends a response with HTML & CSS all sent to the browser
the browser then communicates with the network to make the page.
on snitz.com there are more captures now then in 2000. the captures and URLS were in the same increase/decrease wheras now it is increased highly in 2018
I foung the wayback machine hard to read and also difficult to understand everything is in such small print it is interesting to see all of the old web data.
