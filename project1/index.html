<h2> Get Up</h2>
<h3> by Shinedown</h3>
<hr/>
<p>I know you're clinging to the light of day<br />
To tell you everything's a-okay<br />
A medication don't do much <br />
Yeah, it just numbs the brain<br />
Guess you might say I'm a little intense<br />
I'm on the bright side of being hell bent
So take it from me,<br /> you're not the only one
Who can't see straight.</p>
