For this assignment I decided to use sans-serif because I liked the look. and I tried to add orange and black as background colors.
system is a roster of fonts distributed with windows code pages. That has multiple fonts for each code page. Web typography is the use of fonts on the web. The tag that specifies the font has to be downloaded on a user's computer or known as a fall back font such as sans-serif.
You should not choose fallback fonts carelessly because there are instances where primary fonts load slowly, and the next font in the stack takes its place while processing occurs. Having two unrelated fonts flash in can affect page layout.
Some of the parts I got confused on so parts of mine look different.
